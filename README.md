# AR-Watch-Shopping-APP-Prototype
The project aims at diminishing the traditional method of buying products by benefitting the 
user with visualization of the product on the intended place giving a virtual image of the
product. It strives to benefit its users in convenient ways for shopping for their homes with no 
onsite presence required buying embellished home appliances like furniture, cupboards, 
dining tables and all sorts of necessary products. The application helps the users save their 
time and makes them easy to choose furniture that is best suited with the interior at their own 
ease.
